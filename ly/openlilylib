% This is the main entry file for openLilyLib.
% When this is included different libraries and their modules can be loaded using
% the \import command defined here.

% Including this file also makes available some general helper material that
% is therefore automatically available for any contained library, for example the
% LilyPond version predicates that can be used to create code depending on the
% LilyPond version currently executed

% Include (once) the basic infrastructure of openLilyLib
%
% This does several things:
% - define a global variable 'openlilylib-root
%   which is the absolute path to the root of openLilyLib
%   (the folder this file is located in)
%   This can be used to construct paths to locations in the
%   libraries that are relative to openlilylib-root
% - add this directory to Scheme's module path. Scheme modules
%   can now be created and references from this root too.
% - Add module handling support (\loadModule and friends)
% - Add general tools that are available for all libraries.
%   - lilypond-version-predicates
%   - logging commands
