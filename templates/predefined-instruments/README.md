Are you tired of setting staff labels (instrumentNames),
clefs, midi instruments etc. for every staff you create?
This should help you.

I hope that one day these definitions will make it to the
official LilyPond distribution.

Note: as of 2013-09-06, this is still in very early stage
of development.
