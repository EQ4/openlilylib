* add instructions on how to work with the repo
with something else than github's web interface
* add instructions for "uploading" png files
* add info about branching (when we will have some policy)
* decide on licensing
* document generate-pngs.sh
* mention some cool stuff that may not be obvious to some people:
    * that you can easily link to files and folders
Merge other useful lily repositories, for example:
* https://github.com/mwitmer/LyUtil
* https://github.com/jpvoigt/lalily
* orchestrallily
* i think that we should gather together various lilypond
  repositories under the banner of OpenLilyLib.  For example
  * https://github.com/dliessi/ports

* add some information about pull requests.  Apparently it's quite
easy to forget to click on "send pull request" button, and also
creating a new pull request (choosing appropriate branches) can be
confusing the first time.

* add another category for stuff like displaying control-points and
  coloring voices.  They don't fit "input shorthands" because they're
  not used to produce any input - they are just helpers in the work.
  I just don't know how it should be named.

* btw, "input-shorthands" isn't a very good name either.
