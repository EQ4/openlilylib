`\version` statement
--------------------

If your snippet can be compiled with latest stable LilyPond version,
please mark it as such.  If it cannot be compiled with latest stable,
please indicate the latest version with which it can be compiled.

You may also provide additional information in snippet's `\header`:
- first-known-supported-version
- last-known-supported-version


Documenting snippets
--------------------

This repository can only be maintained if the snippets are self-contained
and self-documented to some extent. For this we are using some kind of
'medadata' in the snippet files.

Please comment your snippet as concisely as possible.
(However, if you don't have time to document it, please submit it and
mark its status as "undocumented". we prefer to have undocumented snippets
rather than no snippets.  Of course, adding documentation later is very
welcome.)
It is good practice to write the snippet as a compilable
LilyPond file and create a usage example as part of the
documentation.
If you provide an example that is rather complex and needs
explanation you can place the snippet in its own subdirectory
and provide a README.md file there too.
GitHub will automatically display this
[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
formatted file on the webpage.


Contributing using advanced tools
---------------------------------

If you'd like to do more (upload png images showing snippet's
output, modify more than one file at a time, etc.), you have to
use something more powerful than web interface.  Please follow
instructions [here](http://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
and [here](http://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
(we will try to add more specific instructions later).
