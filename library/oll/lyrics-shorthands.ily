%{Set melisma behaviour
   Some composers (e.g. Oskar Fried) don't use slurs and beams
   accordings to the standards, so one has to deal with melismaBusyProperties
   - for which the two commands offer shorthands.
   Generally melOn should be active vor vocal melodies,
   so ties, slurs and beams cause a melisma.
   If the lyrics proceed under ties, slurs or beams,
   melOff has to be activated.
   The command has to be placed after the beginning of the syllable

melOff = {
  \set melismaBusyProperties = #'()
}
melOn = {
  \unset melismaBusyProperties
