* word-wrap all markdown files
* add instructions on how to work with the repo
with something else than github's web interface
* add instructions for "uploading" png files
* add info about branching (when we will have some policy)
* decide on licensing
* add a script that would automatically produce missing
png images (using appropriate lily versions for each snippet -
maybe it could even set up the "dev environment", i.e.
prepare appropriate lilyponds using Janek's script
https://github.com/janek-warchol/cli-tools/blob/master/lilypond/build-lily.sh ?)
* mention some cool stuff that may not be obvious to some people:
    * that you can easily link to files and folders
