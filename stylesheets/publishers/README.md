# Publisher's Style Sheets

This directory is for an attempt to create style sheets to mimick famous
publisher's appearance. Initial work has been done by Kieren MacMillan.

Currently this is only a *very* first draft with an initial example, but
there are thought on how to lay this out much better and systematically.
